# Lobby 99 Receipts Downloader
## Intro
At the beginning of each year, Lobby 99 sends an email with all the receipts for the previous year.
The receipts are *not* attached to the email, but rather are links for downloading them.
This process of clicking each file and saveing it is tedious.
This script downloads all the file for you ðŸ˜€

## Usage
- Download the email, and save it as an `eml` file, e.g. `email.eml`
- Run the script: `$python dl_receipts.py email.eml`

All the PDFs will be saved in the current directory.

Enjoy!
